DIE6HE2B_nK,Well this was our Friday at Legoland and your water was under a boil advisery. That you failed to mention upon entering. I had reserved a hotel as well. I have stage 3 cancer and wanted to do something for my kid's spring break. It ended up being a mess. There was no ice and they were working with the bare minimum. Most of the rides were closed. Pepa Pig had more to offer than anything else. There was a roach in your hotel resort that crawled on my husband when he was using the bathroom. There was another in the shower crawling on the soap. The people staying next door were smoking weed and made our room smell of it. I'm still waiting on my $100 hold and I believe I should be completely refunded after this horrible experience at your resort!
DIE6HE2B_nK,PLEASE LET THERE BE MEET AND GREETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
